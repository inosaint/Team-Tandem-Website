            <p>Based on the feedback from Lync meeting, we explored various concepts. This exercise was used to mainly allow us to decide upon the directions that we intend to take next.</p>
            <p>First we built a parody concept, Family-book, which was an overgrown social network. It solved the problem (of archiving & retrieving memories) but was not an elegant way of solving it. The world does not need just another social network. It was a reminder that we should not end up with a product like this.</p>
            <p>We decided to take a core point and build a concept around it. We thought of the concept of teaching values and traditions to the younger generation. Hence a game, "Simile" was born, targeted at tweens, to help learn by playing.</p>
            <p>Next came a concept of 'Yaadein' which was built around the fact that people like to reminisce during their leisure time and this tool would enable them to access their digital memories when sitting in the comfort of their couch. This included aspects like Summary of important memories, huge display (on a wall? big screen?), immersive interactions etc.</p>
            <p>'Objectify' was a concept which dealt with collecting the digital memories in physical objects and helping people reminisce better when they come across objects like showpieces or physical invites. Memories could be added regularly to objects, or shared across various objects.</p>
            <div class = "row">
            <div class="six columns" style="color:#234111">
            <p>'Treasure Text' was a simple concept about receiving and adding a memory a day into a system which would use it to build a bigger picture using prompts. Restricting it to only one memory would make it an easy task to add memories, and making it daily would make it like a ritual.</p>
            <p>We also dabbled with a life-logging concept called 'Gistify' which was meant for storytelling about the Indian family functions like marriages, births, etc. in a collaboratively.</p>

            </div>  
            </div>
            <p>We debated amongst ourselves and decided that the core ideas in 'Simile', 'Treasure Text' and 'Gistify' would be what we would want to explore more.</p>

            <p>Post the juries, we got back to our research. We looked at startups and companies in the same space. We came across 'The Indian Memory Project' by a NID alumnus, Anusha Yadav, which chose to depict the collective history of India through media like photographs, postcards.
            We also came across a study by the University of Portsmouth about how 'Looking at pictures of yourself can make you happy'. A little narcissist maybe but it has its roots in reminiscent therapy.</p>
            <img src="images/Photo-of-photos.jpg" />
            <p>Easter came and Kenneth had to go home. The rest of the team did a bit of user research by visiting people in their home, talking about families, photographs & sharing memories. We also observed how they use photographs & objects to recollect old memories.</p>
            <p>We had the presentation with Nithin Ismail, Justin George & Deepak Menon from Microsoft on April 2nd. The presentation was made via Lync (online) and we were told that it’s time to start building a model and finalize on a concept.</p>

            <p>The Jury week was approaching and we were busy with the pre-jury preparation. We had to present our project at its current state to the panel and we had to accumulate all the work since the first pitch and make it presentable. March 22 was the jury when we presented our work so far and the panel was quite happy with the idea and the process that we were following. They ended up recommending us some reading and one of the judges actually summarized our idea as 'Family as a collective memory'.</p>

            <p> As part of our user research we started the interviews, talking to people about family and other cultural aspects around which the whole system revolves. What are their daily activities and how they balance their work-home life. We talked to them about their experience/understanding about families(joint/nuclear) and relatives. 
            Here are some of the responses that we got:
<blockquote>“First of things have special memories.”<br>
— Consultant (50 years old), preserves memories using photographs.
</blockquote><blockquote>“Had it not been for a family, I might not have believed in spirituality.” <br>
—Income Tax Officer (42 years old), maintains a family tree
</blockquote><blockquote>“Joint family may seem like a bad option but its not.”<br>
— Homemaker (35 years old), quit work when son was born
</blockquote><blockquote>“I want my kid to have his own experiences and learn from them. I want to guide him and not take his decisions for him.”<br>
— Software Engineer (31 years old), leaves kid at daycare when at work
</blockquote><blockquote>“Too much togetherness is not good. I have relatives I can’t relate to.”<br>
— Student (24 years old), part of joint family

            <p>Week 4 was spent with us doing both literature review as well as preliminary user research via personal & telephonic interviews. We found several examples of family tree applications, but none seemed to focus on preserving culture, and heritage. We also spent time with Prof. Vinod Vidwans, who helped us think beyond current technologies and brainstorm on futuristic ideas. It helped us to come out of a narrow mindset and gave us a new direction!</p>
            <p> Some of the ideas discussed (Futuristic, impossible to implement) were:
          <ul>
            <li>Wearable Memories: Clothes that record memories. Dresses worn on special events like Anniversaries store special memories</li>
            <li>Holograms for connecting with (geographically) distant family members</li>
            <li>Objects in public spaces that record memories, and allow you to recap them whenever you visit them next</li>
            <li>Cubes for preserving languages and teaching them to next generations</li>
            <li>A box of memories: Like the heirlooms passed on from one generation to another</li>
          </ul>

          </div>

        <p>The last idea appealed to us more, and we decided to spend more time exploring this idea.</p>

        <p>The week ended with the three of us attending the Global Service Jam (Bangalore).</p>

        <p>Week 3 was mostly spent with us trying to come up with a brief and juggle other assignments.</p>
        <p>Lot of preliminary research and mind mapping was done so that we could narrow down our topic slightly.</p>
          
        <p>We gave our pitch to Mr. Nithin Ismail from Microsoft. His feedback was mostly positive, and he also emphasized on not narrowing our ideas based on the final outcome. He wanted to ensure that we don't just restrict to the stories aspect.</p>

        <p>Now that our idea has some kind of validation, we began to chart out a plan to execute the research.</p>

            <p>Week 1 actually started when we were given the brief. We were not really sure how we would merge it into this semester's Design Project theme <strong>'Culture and Communication'</strong>.</p>
            <p>The team sat and brainstormed ideas which would use the attributes of both big data and culture.</p>
            <p>We spent the first week exploring two themes: Energy conservation for modern homes & Persuasive design for preventing food wastage at cafeterias.</p>
          </div>

            <img src="images/Scenarios-1.jpg" />
          </div>
        </div>

        
        <p>By the end of the first week, we weren't happy with the two ideas and decided to start afresh. We were clear about one thing though, as this project was spread over a longer duration than normal we wanted to follow a proper design process. We were also trying hard to not get narrowed down with the final outcome. We didn't want to just build <em>another</em> app!</p>

        <p>As we brainstormed, we kept coming back to the concept of 'families' and 'stories'.</p>

        <p>We decided to make this our central theme.</p>
